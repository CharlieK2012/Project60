<p> A well-balanced diet provides all of the: energy you need to keep active throughout the day. nutrients you need for growth and repair, helping you to stay strong and healthy and help to prevent diet-related illness, such as some cancers.
    My favorite food is KFC because it has all kinds of chicken, saucses and sides.
